# LangChain Intro
Welcome to the LangChain Tech-Talk! In this guide, you'll find instructions on how to set up and run the demo scripts that will accompany our presentation. By following these steps, you'll be able to see firsthand the power and utility of LangChain in action.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (usually comes bundled with Node.js)
- Valid OpenAI api key

## Installation & Setup

### Clone repository
If you haven't already, begin by cloning the repository:
- git clone [<repository-url>](https://github.com/alainkaiser/langchain-talk.git)https://github.com/alainkaiser/langchain-talk.git
- cd "langchain-talk"

### Install dependencies
Install all dependencies via `npm i`

### Setup Your .env File
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project. This file will hold your secret API key for OpenAI. Add the following line to the file:
